This directory contains binary files and command procedures for Amos
II users.  
 
Running the AMOS II system:
--------------------------

Run (or click on) the executable:

  amos2

Running the AMOS II tutorial:
-----------------------------

To learn a little how to use Amos II, run the executable:

  < '../demo/tutorial.amosql';

There is a manual in:

../doc/amos_users_guide.html

Interface to Java language and GOOVI browser:
---------------------------------------------

A. You first need to download the 32 bits (!!) Java virtual machine from

   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html

B. Then set environment variables:

   1) Set PATH to include this directory.
   2) Set CLASSPATH to include javaamos.jar in this directory.

C. Run Amos from the Java virtual machine by calling the
   command procedure:

           javaamos <database image file> 

   javaamos.bat requires as first parameter the exact path to a
   database image file (default is 'amos2.dmp').
 
   You will then enter the Amos II top loop as with amos2.exe, but
   inside the Java virtual machine. 

   The multi-database browser Goovi can then be started with the 
   following function call:

           goovi();
