DVA409 with Volvo CE, Eskilstuna

The Project group is a four member team consisting of students at M�lardalen University, V�ster�s under the supervision of Tomas Olsson.
The project members are :
1. Ande Hana
2. Konstantinos Konstantopoulos
3. Oscar Svensson
4. Tobias Larsen
5. Debajyoti Nag

The project aims at developing a system
that will work in unison with AMOS II and help in
monitoring and diagnosis of machines from the data
collected on site by comparing it with test data used to
train the system. The system implements a CBR that uses
probabilistic density functions to classify incoming cases,
and then allows the user to do a Nearest Neighbors
Search on the case library.
